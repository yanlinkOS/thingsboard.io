# Migrate PE Docs to PaaS (Cloud)

Create PaaS US and PaaS EU documentation stubs that mirror the PE docs structure, reusing the same shared includes with appropriate product props and conditionals.

---

## Key Concepts

### PaaS = PE in the Cloud

ThingsBoard Cloud (PaaS) is the PE edition hosted as a managed service. It shares all PE features (dashboard groups, RBAC, device ownership, entity groups, etc.) with these differences:

- **User is a Tenant** — no access to System Administrator settings
- **No self-managed installation** — no Docker, no backend configuration
- **No custom rule nodes** — cannot deploy custom server-side code
- **Specific hostnames** per region (not `localhost`)

### Host Configuration by Product

| Field | CE | PE | PaaS (NA) | PaaS (EU) |
|-------|----|----|-----------|-----------|
| hostLabel | localhost | localhost | ThingsBoard Cloud | ThingsBoard Cloud EU |
| hostName | localhost | localhost | thingsboard.cloud | eu.thingsboard.cloud |
| mqttHostName | localhost | localhost | mqtt.thingsboard.cloud | mqtt.eu.thingsboard.cloud |
| coapHostName | localhost | localhost | coap.thingsboard.cloud | coap.eu.thingsboard.cloud |
| httpsUrl | https://localhost | https://thingsboard.cloud | https://thingsboard.cloud | https://eu.thingsboard.cloud |
| lwm2mHostName | localhost | lwm2m.thingsboard.cloud | lwm2m.thingsboard.cloud | lwm2m.eu.thingsboard.cloud |
| apiHostName | localhost | YOUR_SERVER_HOSTNAME | thingsboard.cloud | eu.thingsboard.cloud |

### Products Enum

```ts
Products.PAAS     // PaaS North America — prefix: paas/
Products.PAAS_EU  // PaaS Europe — prefix: paas/eu/
```

---

## Step 0: Identify the PE pages to migrate

The user will specify a section (e.g., "Getting Started tab", "Guides > Security"). Identify all PE stub files and their corresponding shared includes.

```
src/content/docs/docs/pe/{path}/{page}.mdx         ← PE stub to copy from
src/content/_includes/docs/{path}/{page}.mdx        ← shared include (already exists)
```

---

## Step 1: Create PaaS US stubs

For each PE stub, create a corresponding PaaS US stub at:

```
src/content/docs/docs/paas/{path}/{page}.mdx
```

**Template** — copy the PE stub exactly, change only the product:

```mdx
---
title: '<same as PE>'
description: '<same as PE>'
---
import PageComponent from '@includes/docs/{path}/{page}.mdx'
import { Products } from '~/models/site.models'

<PageComponent product={Products.PAAS}/>
```

**Important:**
- If the PE stub imports from a PE-specific include (e.g., `getting-started-pe/4.mdx`), the PaaS stub should import from the same PE-specific include.
- Copy frontmatter exactly from the PE stub (title, description, type, sidebar, head, etc.).

---

## Step 2: Create PaaS EU stubs

Same structure at:

```
src/content/docs/docs/paas/eu/{path}/{page}.mdx
```

Identical to PaaS US stubs but with `Products.PAAS_EU`.

---

## Step 3: Adapt shared includes for PaaS

Review every shared include used by the new PaaS stubs. Look for content that doesn't apply to PaaS users.

### 3.1 Expand PE-only conditionals

PaaS has all PE features. Any conditional that checks for PE must also include PaaS:

```diff
- {props.product === Products.PE && <li>PE-only content</li>}
+ {[Products.PE, Products.PAAS, Products.PAAS_EU].includes(props.product) && <li>PE-only content</li>}
```

Add the `Products` import if not already present:
```mdx
import { Products } from '@models/site.models.ts';
```

### 3.2 Hide system admin / installation content

PaaS users are tenants — they don't install or configure the server. Hide content about:
- Self-managed installation instructions
- Backend configuration / `thingsboard.yml` settings
- System administrator operations
- Custom rule node development/deployment
- Docker commands, server startup

**Pattern for hiding content from PaaS:**
```mdx
{![Products.PAAS, Products.PAAS_EU].includes(props.product) && <>
<h2>Section only for CE/PE</h2>
<p>Content here...</p>
</>}
```

**IMPORTANT: Markdown does NOT render inside JSX fragments (`<>...</>`).** Use HTML tags:
- `<h2>` instead of `##`
- `<p>` instead of plain paragraphs
- `<ul><li>` instead of `- `
- `<strong>` instead of `**`
- `<code>` instead of backticks
- `<hr/>` instead of `---`
- `<a href="...">` for external links inside JSX

### 3.3 Add PaaS-specific content

For content that differs between PaaS and CE/PE (e.g., login instructions, cloud URLs):

```mdx
{props.product === Products.PAAS && (
<p>Open <a href="https://thingsboard.cloud/"><strong>ThingsBoard Cloud</strong></a> and sign in.</p>
)}
{props.product === Products.PAAS_EU && (
<p>Open <a href="https://eu.thingsboard.cloud/"><strong>ThingsBoard Cloud EU</strong></a> and sign in.</p>
)}
{![Products.PAAS, Products.PAAS_EU].includes(props.product) && <>
<p>Open the ThingsBoard web interface and sign in with your credentials.</p>
</>}
```

### 3.4 Host name substitution

When includes contain `localhost` or hardcoded hostnames in code examples, commands, or URLs — add product-aware conditionals using the host table above.

---

## Step 4: Update sidebar (`astro.sidebar.ts`)

Add entries to `paasSidebar` and `paasEuSidebar`. Mirror the PE sidebar structure:

```ts
export const paasSidebar: SidebarConfig = [
  {
    label: 'Section Name',
    translations: { uk: 'Назва' },
    items: [
      'docs/paas/{path}/{page}',
      // ...
    ],
  },
  // ... existing sections
];
```

Same for `paasEuSidebar` with `docs/paas/eu/` prefix.

**Do NOT use `mainSidebarItems()` for PaaS** — the PaaS sidebar is manually defined because not all CE/PE sections apply (no Installation tab, for example).

---

## Step 5: Fix broken links

After creating stubs and adapting includes:

1. Search all affected includes for `path='TODO'` or `path='user-guide/TBD/'` placeholder links.
2. Find the actual target page using glob: `src/content/docs/docs/pe/{guessed-path}.mdx`.
3. Replace with the correct path (no leading slash, no trailing slash).
4. For links that have no target page yet, convert to bold text: `**Link Text**` (remove the `<DocLink>`).
5. For external URLs (cloud signup, etc.), use `<a href="...">` — not `<DocLink>`.
6. Use `bold={false}` on `<DocLink>` when the link appears in running text and bold styling would be distracting.

---

## Step 6: Verify

1. Run `pnpm build:fast` to check for build errors.
2. Navigate to the new PaaS pages in the browser to verify rendering.
3. Check that the sidebar shows all new entries.
4. Verify PE conditionals render correctly on PaaS pages.
5. Verify hidden content (installation, sysadmin) does not appear on PaaS pages.
