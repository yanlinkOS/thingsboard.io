	about: {
		shortText:
			'The global challenges of water scarcity, rising agricultural costs, and the need for sustainable farming have made smart irrigation not just a trend, but a necessity. Traditional watering systems often lack responsiveness, leading to water overuse and crop stress. Modern agriculture requires a platform that can bring automation, precision, and adaptability — exactly what ThingsBoard delivers.',
		longText: [
			'ThingsBoard IoT Platform is purpose-built to address these needs with its robust architecture, supporting seamless integration of diverse sensors, reliable data collection via MQTT, CoAP, or HTTP, and powerful real-time analytics. By enabling farmers to monitor soil conditions, receive threshold-based alarms, and automate irrigation actions through intuitive rule chains, ThingsBoard ensures optimal water distribution and timely response to changing field conditions.',
			'From small farms to enterprise-scale agricultural operations, ThingsBoard scales effortlessly thanks to its edge computing capabilities, multi-tenant model, and rich dashboard customization. It empowers agribusinesses to implement smart irrigation that not only conserves water and boosts yield, but also reduces manual labor, improves traceability, and aligns with long-term sustainability goals.',
