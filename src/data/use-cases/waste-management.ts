		shortText:
			'As urban populations grow and sustainability standards tighten, waste management systems must evolve to be more efficient, scalable, and data-driven. Traditional methods — based on fixed collection schedules and manual checks —often result in overflows, resource waste, and high operational costs. ThingsBoard IoT Platform effectively addresses these challenges, offering powerful tools for real-time monitoring, automation, and optimization of waste operations.',
		longText: [
			'ThingsBoard IoT platform transforms waste collection logistics for cities, campuses, and enterprises by enabling real-time monitoring through sensor-equipped bins. As these sensors transmit live data on fill levels, battery status, and connectivity, ThingsBoard processes the telemetry instantly, allowing operators to reduce unnecessary pickups, lower emissions, and respond proactively to service needs. With its flexible device integration, rule-based automation, and customizable dashboards, ThingsBoard empowers waste management teams to deploy quickly, scale easily, and make smarter decisions based on actionable insights.',
			'Supporting industry-standard protocols like MQTT, CoAP, and HTTP, ThingsBoard enables seamless sensor connectivity at scale. Its Rule Engine allows for complex event processing and alarming, while multi-tenant architecture supports parallel use by multiple stakeholders — from city departments to private contractors. Combined with powerful analytics and visualization tools, ThingsBoard delivers a complete, future-ready solution for intelligent waste management.',

			'The ThingsBoard-powered <a href="/docs/pe/recipes/solution-templates/waste-management/">waste management solution</a> begins at the edge — where IoT sensors installed in bins monitor fill levels and battery status in real time.

Thanks to ThingsBoard gateway and built-in integration capabilities, even legacy systems and non-IP sensors can be seamlessly connected.',

Rule Engine chains trigger alarms based on predefined conditions such as low battery or bins nearing capacity. Finally, this structured information is presented on interactive dashboards, allowing operators to make timely decisions and optimize collection routes. All of this can be managed in a multi-tenant environment, enabling smart city operators, private contractors, and utility providers to co-manage waste operations securely.',
