		shortText:
			'Modern enterprises that manage liquid storage — from fuel to water — face the critical need for continuous tank level monitoring and infrastructure status control. Poor monitoring can lead to leaks, equipment downtime, and higher operational costs. In this context, IoT-powered solutions become essential for digital transformation. The ThingsBoard IoT platform addresses these challenges with ease.',
		longText: [
			'The ThingsBoard platform offers a comprehensive approach to tank level monitoring, enabling real-time tracking of key metrics such as volume, temperature, sensor battery level, and connectivity status. Thanks to its flexibility, ThingsBoard can be easily tailored to meet industry-specific needs, whether for small-scale or enterprise-wide deployments.',
			'ThingsBoard stands out due to its scalability, support for multiple protocols (MQTT, HTTP, CoAP, and others), customizable dashboards, and robust device management tools. It empowers users to deploy both local and cloud-based solutions that effectively monitor dispersed tank networks at any scale.',

			'The <a href="/docs/pe/recipes/solution-templates/fuel-level-monitoring/">tank level monitoring</a> solution integrates IoT sensors — such as level, temperature, and battery — with the ThingsBoard platform. Data is transmitted via standard protocols: MQTT for real-time telemetry, HTTP for periodic updates, and CoAP for low-power environments. This ensures reliable, efficient communication across a wide range of devices and conditions.',
