		shortText:
			'Modern agriculture is undergoing a digital transformation driven by the need for sustainability, efficiency, and resilience. Farmers and agricultural enterprises face increasing pressure to optimize yield, reduce resource consumption, and mitigate risks related to climate and storage. ThingsBoard easily handles this task by providing real-time data collection, automation, and intuitive visualization tailored for smart farming needs.',
		longText: [
			'ThingsBoard IoT platform empowers agricultural stakeholders with a robust, scalable solution to collect, process, and visualize environmental and operational data. Its support for multiple communication protocols and seamless device integration makes it ideal for diverse farming environments, whether remote fields, greenhouses, or storage facilities.',
			'By leveraging ThingsBoard, agribusinesses gain full control over assets and infrastructure — from temperature and humidity sensors to automated aeration systems. With real-time dashboards, rule-based alerts, and remote control features, the platform helps reduce waste, improve crop quality, and lower operational costs.',
