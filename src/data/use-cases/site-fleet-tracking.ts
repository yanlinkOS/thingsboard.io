		shortText:
			'Clay mining operations present a high-risk, high-movement environment, where visibility, safety, and fuel efficiency are critical. Coordinating fleets of excavators and haul trucks across loading, unloading, and restricted zones requires more than GPS — it demands precision logic and real-time automation.',
		longText: [
			'ThingsBoard delivers a robust answer to this challenge. Built with scalability, real-time analytics, and geospatial control at its core, the platform transforms how mine operators monitor and manage their equipment — all without using Rule Chains.',
			'This Clay Mine Site solution leverages calculated fields, geofencing logic, and alarm rules only to streamline configuration, reduce deployment time, and drive intelligent insights from the ground up. With zero-code automation and dynamic dashboards, operations become more predictable, safer, and easier to scale.',
