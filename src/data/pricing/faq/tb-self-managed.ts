				id: 'pe-pay-as-you-go-pentest',
				question: 'Do you provide pentest results?',
				answer: '<p>No, we do not do it for many reasons. Firstly, as a platform vendor, we cannot disclose detected vulnerabilities of certain versions of the platform as the disclosure affects the safety of our existing customers who use that particular version. Secondly, the self-declared pentest is less trustworthy as it is in the vendor\'s interest to come up with clean results and you never know whether to believe them or not. Lastly, the penetration test makes more sense to be conducted over a ready-to-use end client software/application to define weak spots (if any). It is the Licensee\'s responsibility to order independent testing. Having said that, the ThingsBoard platform gives one a tool to develop solutions. You may consider the platform a building that a banker rents to establish an office, vault, etc. Now you can see that testing a building itself does not make much sense. But things change when it hosts a bank (or whatever tenant).</p>',

				question: 'Can I upgrade from Edge CE to Edge PE?',
				answer: '<p>Yes, but you\'ll need to upgrade your entire system: upgrade your ThingsBoard Server from CE to PE, purchase the Edge Computing add-on, and reinstall Edge using PE packages. Please <a target="_blank" href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> for migration assistance.</p>',
			},
			{
				id: 'edge-addon-payg-separate-license',
				question: 'Do I need a separate license to use Edge Computing add-on?',
				answer: '<p>No. Once you have an active ThingsBoard PE license (Cloud, Private Cloud, or self-managed), you can purchase and activate the Edge Computing add-on directly. The add-on itself serves as the license for your Edge instances. No additional licensing is required.</p>',

You can\'t select specific devices or assets; all entities will be analyzed and added to the \'business entity\' column.</p>',

			{
				id: 'trendz-payg-standalone',
				question: 'Can I use Trendz without ThingsBoard?',
				answer: '<p>No, you cannot use Trendz without ThingsBoard. Trendz automatically detects and analyzes all entities from your ThingsBoard instance. Without ThingsBoard, Trendz has no data source to work with, making it incompatible for use on its own.</p>',

			{
				id: 'trendz-payg-installation-help',
				question: 'How can I get help with installation and setup?',
				answer: '<p>If your subscription plan includes basic support and you have access to the Support Portal, the Trendz support team can assist with system deployment as part of basic support. However, this applies only if you follow recommended installation methods and architecture. Custom installation scripts or non-recommended deployment scenarios are not covered under basic support.</p>\n<p>If your subscription plan does not include basic support, we recommend using our documentation, tutorials, and optional professional services.
